The `do` function and Python functionality can be configured to activate agents in different orders. This can be important as the order in which agents are activated can impact the results of the model [Comer2014]. At each step of the model, one or more of the agents -- usually all of them -- are activated and take their own step, changing internally and/or interacting with one another or the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model-specific information:** For this section we will randomly reorder the Agent activation order using  `mesa.Agent.shuffle_do` and have the agents `step` function print the agent's unique id that they were assigned during the agent creation process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Code implementation:** Using standard ABM convention we add a `step` function to the `MoneyModel` class which calls the `mesa.Agent.shuffle_do` function.
